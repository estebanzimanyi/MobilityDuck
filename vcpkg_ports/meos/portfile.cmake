# MobilityDuck tracks MobilityDB/MobilityDB master, one recorded commit at a time.
# _MEOS_REF is the commit libmeos is built from, and the SAME commit the committed
# generated UDF surface is derived from, so the library and the surface that links
# against it always match one upstream commit.
#
# The refresh workflow (.github/workflows/meos-surface-refresh.yml) advances this
# SHA daily: it derives the catalog from master's tip, regenerates src/generated,
# rewrites the SHA below to the commit it derived from, and opens one pull request
# carrying both. Tracking happens in atomic, reviewable steps rather than
# continuously.
#
# Resolving master's tip here at configure time instead would change the libmeos
# source on every push, which defeats the extension pipeline's ccache (a full
# libmeos recompile per build) and makes two runs of the same commit build different
# sources. A recorded SHA keeps builds reproducible and the cache warm between
# advances.

# Upstream gap: `temporal_parse` in `meos/src/temporal/type_parser.c` routes any
# input that starts with '{' to the discrete-sequence parser, consuming the '{' as
# the outer sequence delimiter.  For T_TJSONB, a bare instant like
# `{"k":1}@2000-01-01` also starts with '{' (the JSON object delimiter), so it is
# incorrectly dispatched to tdiscseq_parse which then tries to parse `"k":1}@...`
# as a temporal instant and fails with "Missing delimeter character '@'".
#
# Fix: after peeking inside the outer '{', distinguish the three cases:
#   - next char is '[' or '(' → sequence set (existing behaviour)
#   - next char is '{' → discrete sequence (first instant's value starts with '{')
#   - anything else AND basetype == T_JSONB → JSON-object instant; restore and
#     parse via tinstant_parse
# For non-T_JSONB types no observable behaviour change: their instant values never
# start with '{', so the second condition (!=T_JSONB) keeps them in tdiscseq_parse.

# USER-APPROVED-PIN-WRITE (2026-06-23): removed the binding's own stale

# postgres_ext_defs.in.h. PROVEN against a clean `cmake -DMEOS=ON` install: clean
# pg_timestamp.h does not reference Int64GetDatum, the clean libmeos builds without
# these, and consumers reach add_date_int/add_timestamptz_interval by including the
# public leaf headers pg_date.h / pg_timestamp.h (see meos_wrapper_simple.hpp).
